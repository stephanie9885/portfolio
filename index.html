  <section class="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about designing and improving people-centered systems. In past roles, I’ve supported HR, recruiting, and training efforts by bringing structure to onboarding programs, streamlining documentation, and creating dashboards that track engagement, retention, and ramp-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background includes scheduling, compliance, internal communication, referral management, and hands-on hiring coordination. I enjoy collaborating with L&D, HR, and operations teams to make workflows smoother and more transparent.

    <h2>Improving Onboarding & Hiring Through Process</h2>
    <p>
      When onboarding or hiring processes feel disorganized, people feel it. That’s why I focus on making the back end as clean and supportive as the front end is welcoming. From creating SharePoint portals to mapping candidate journeys to surfacing the right KPIs—my goal is always clarity and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      These dashboards are just one part of my toolkit. I’ve also led onboarding redesigns, created SOPs, and built systems that improve communication across departments and reduce drop-off during critical early days.
